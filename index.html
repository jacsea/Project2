        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          My design process began with going over all four datasets, and trying to come up with visualizations that could work as a pair 
          that contrast each other. Each dataset had many variables, which made it harder to narrow it down to a specific topic. 
          I eventually landed on the dataset which collected abortion data from the Guttmacher Institute. 
          While I realized there were many different complex visualizations that could be drawn from the dataset, I decided on a rather 
          simple one.           
        </p>

        <p>
          The main deception employed in my visualization is the different type of change of the y-axis, from percent change to absolute change of the number of
          abortion clinics from 2017-2020. While each graph is trying to get across the same information by using the change of abortion clinics, 
          the different types of change each graph shows is deceptive. Because of the change of variable, even though each graph is attempting to show the same thing, the change in abortion clinics, 
          vastly different conclusions can be made from each chart. The only other thing that may be deemed deceptive was making the mark a line, which implies trend over time. 
          While it is true that this does happen over time, arbitrarily starting the lines at 0 alongside the fact that there was no data for the years between 2017 and 2020,
          helps in the deception of the visualization. I purposely kept each graph simple and 
          similar to each other to make them easy to read and draw conclusions from, and also to show how drastic the change can be when 
          visualizing percent change versus absolute change. Other than that each graph is completely earnest. 
          Annotations were not added as each graph was meant to show visual disparity between states, not necessarily a numercial difference. 
          The titles and axes titles are all correct and the colors do not implicate anything good or bad, which is important with a controversial topic like abortion. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I thought this visualization was interesting as both graphs are aiming to display the same data on the same topic but show it in different ways. 
          While both graphs are technically true, each one does not tell the whole truth. 
          The change in y-axis from percent change to absolute change paints a drastically different picture of the data. It is easy 
          to imagine how each graph could be used to sway perception a certain way, and especially with small tweaks like color it could be used 
          to push even further towards certain agendas. In my opinion, both of these graphs fall more towards misleading than persuasive. 
          Percent change is easily skewed as while Kentucky has by far the largest percent change of 100%, that is because it went from one clinic 
          to two clinics. But California having the highest absolute change of 12 is not reflective of that fact that it already had 161 clinics 
          making it a less impactful relative change. In my opinion, a more earnest visualization would add both absolute and percent change, 
          a simple example being the same absolute change plot above, but with percent change annotated to the side of the state name.
